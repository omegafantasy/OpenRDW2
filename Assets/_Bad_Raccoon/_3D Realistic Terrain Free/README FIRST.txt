UPDATE 1.2

Hi

Here is a free realistic terrain sample! It can be tiled to create more big world! (flighsim?)
The textures are provided to 8K and the terrains RAW 16 datas are provided to 2K. 

Diffuse textures are not color/editable, but you can add your own, with another splatting layer
to draw roads or anything you want :) there is 3 green variations, use them on the material : Terrain_A

If you resize the terrain, resize also the texture in the terrain paint layer (same size for both)

I hope you like it!
